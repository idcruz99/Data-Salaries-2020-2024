# Data Salaries 2020-2024
<h1> Purpose </h1>
The purpose of this project is to portray the range of salaries across the globe for different Data positions at different experience levels. My goal for this data visualization project is to help recent graduates and inexperienced data analysts who are deciding on a career path to be able to weigh their options. 
<h1> Sources Used </h1>
Data Visualization Tool: Power BI

Dataset: [Data Science Job Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) from Kaggle
<h1> Project Walk-Through </h1>
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<li>Take out any unneeded columns in dataset</li>
<li>Rename columns</li>
<li>Import dataset from excel into Power BI, then transform the data to make any visual changes before loading data</li>

<h3>Create Visuals</h3>
For my visuals, I used a card to show the total amount of survey takers, a clustered column chart to show the average salary in USD for the most common positions, a line chart to show the increases or 
decreases in salary from 2020-2024, and a map to highlight the company locations and sizes.

Because there are so many survey takers and hundreds of specific job titles, I only chose the most highly populated job titles from the dataset. To do this, I added a filter: top 12 by Count of JobTitle. This makes the visual much more condensed but still very functionable for its purpose. 

After adding filters to each visual, I just had to edit the value names and titles. Then, I changed the theme so that the colors that signify experience levels would be distinguishable and presentable.

<h1> Interactivity </h1>
The user can select any data point on a visual and it will influence all visuals on the screen to pertain to that specific data point. For example, if the user selects a company on the map, it will display the relevant information for that specific survey taker's salary.
